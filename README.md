This tutorial provides a very basic sample example of how Dataflow can be used to read data from GCS to Pub/Sub.

Additional example provides a different pipeline that reads data from Pub/Sub to GCS.

Also, I have included a sample Airflow DAG that can be deployed on Google Cloud Composer(managed Airflow) in order to 
execute multiple pipelines simultaneously.
